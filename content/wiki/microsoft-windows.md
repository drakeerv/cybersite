**Microsoft Windows**, commonly known as **Windows**, is a general-purpose operating system designed and developed by [Microsoft](w:microsoft) [1]. It is noted for its status as the most popular desktop operating system and its strong backwards compatibility.

The initial release in 1985 marked the beginning of a long journey, which eventually moved from a DOS-based architecture to the more robust NT kernel used today.
